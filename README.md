# o80_kalman_filter

## Introduction
This is a Kalman Filter written for Pamy's vision system. Its primary functions include: 

* Using the Kalman Filter to estimate the states (position and velocity) of a ping-pong ball within the field of view. 
* Detecting impacts between the ping-pong ball and the surrounding environment (currently including the table and the ground) and predicting the states of the ball after the impact. 
* Predicting the future trajectory of the ping-pong ball based on the given states of the ball.
